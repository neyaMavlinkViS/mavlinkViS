float64 pitch_y   # pitchY specifies the platform's rotation about the lateral axis (e.g. the axis parallel to the wings) in a locally level, North-East-Down coordinate system centered on the platform. Pitch is zero when the platform is "nose to tail" level in the North-East plane. The measurement is stated in radians between -0.5 pi and 0.5 pi.
float64 roll_x   # rollX specifies the platform's rotation about the longitudinal axis (e.g. the axis through the body of an aircraft from tail to nose) in a locally level, North-East-Down coordinate system centered on the platform. Roll is zero when the platform is "wing-tip to wing-tip" level in the North-East plane. The measurement is stated in radians between -pi and pi.
float64 yaw_z   # yawZ specifies the platform's rotation about the vertical axis (e.g. the axis from top to bottom through an aircraft) in a locally level, North-East-Down coordinate system centered on the platform. By this definition, yaw is zero when the platform is oriented toward true North and is equivalent to true North referenced heading. The measurement is stated in radians between -pi and pi.
